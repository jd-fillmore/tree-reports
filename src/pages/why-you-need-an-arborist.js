                  Arborists specialize in the care of individual trees. They are
                  knowledgeable about the needs of trees, and are trained and
                  equipped to provide proper care. Hiring an arborist is a
                  decision that should not be taken lightly. Proper tree care is
                  an investment that can lead to substantial returns. Well
                  cared-for trees are attractive and can add considerable value
                  to your property. Poorly maintained trees can be a significant
                  liability. Pruning or removing trees, especially large trees,
                  can be dangerous work. Tree work should be done only by those
                  trained and equipped to work safely in trees.

                <h2>What is a Certified Arborist?</h2>
                <p>
                  An arborist by definition is an individual who is trained in
                  the art and science of planting, caring for, and maintaining
                  individual trees. ISA arborist certification is a
                  nongovernmental, voluntary process by which individuals can
                  document their base of knowledge. Certified Arborists are
                  individuals who have achieved a level of knowledge in the art
                  and science of tree care through experience and by passing a
                  comprehensive examination developed by some of the nationâ€™s
                  leading experts on tree care.
